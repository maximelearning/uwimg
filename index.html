        We watch them, feed them, count them, 
        protect them, and more, but what even is a bird?
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the dawn of time man has looked to the sky and dreamed of flight,
        only to behold the teeming masses of feathered scoundrels that have already claimed
        and squandered that gift. This humble project seeks to lay the foundations of 
        identifying and understanding the foe, so that others may continue the work.
    </p>


    <h2>Laying the Foundations</h2>

    <p>
        To begin classification of these godless heathens of the sky we started 
        with variations of ResNet, which are deep residual networks 
        pre-trained on the ImageNet Dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to have the best data to train this model we attempted to use
        larger resolution training data. However we received a major setback when 
        we realized the enemy had infiltrated even the hallowed halls of the 
        Kaggle platform, and was attempting to halt our progress by throttling our 
        allotted GPU memory reserves. We were forced to compromize and settled on a 
        smaller resolution than originally planned, and further reduced the batch
        size so we would not go over memory limits. 
    </p>

    <div class="c"><code><pre>
    transform_train = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(300),
        transforms.RandomCrop(300, padding=16, padding_mode='edge'), 
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),    
        transforms.ToTensor(),
    ])

    ...

    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=40, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
    </pre></code></div>

    <p>
        After some trial and error we settled on a configuration that seemed to 
        perform well for the smaller models of ResNet18, it was time to begin training
        the more advanced recruits.

    <h3>ResNet152 V1</h3>
    <p>Here the birds struck back with a vengence, angered by our progress they 
        sabotaged our training during the night. We managed to pick up where we 
        left off by loading a checkpoint, and ceased further training till we tested 
        how the current model performed.

    <h3>ResNet152 V2</h3>
    <p>
        With our alloted GPU Acceleration quota rapidly diminishing, we had to take
        drastic action to make sure we saved our progress throught the training cycle.
        The modified training code now took smaller images and saved some predictions 
        every 5 Epochs. It reloads from the checkpoint and continues its training,
        never ceasing in its relentless quest to identify those vile birds!
